- `bin/rails server` - Start Rails server only
- `bin/rails console` - Open Rails console

### Testing
- `bin/rails test` - Run all tests
- `bin/rails test:db` - Run tests with database reset
- `bin/rails test:system` - Run system tests only (use sparingly - they take longer)
- `bin/rails test test/models/account_test.rb` - Run specific test file
- `bin/rails test test/models/account_test.rb:42` - Run specific test at line

### Linting & Formatting
- `bin/rubocop` - Run Ruby linter

- `bin/rails db:rollback` - Rollback last migration
- `bin/rails db:seed` - Load seed data

### Setup
- `bin/setup` - Initial project setup (installs dependencies, prepares database)

## Pre-Pull Request CI Workflow

ALWAYS run these commands before opening a pull request:

1. **Tests** (Required):
   - `bin/rails test` - Run all tests (always required)
   - `bin/rails test:system` - Run system tests (only when applicable, they take longer)

2. **Linting** (Required):
   - `bin/rubocop -f github -a` - Ruby linting with auto-correct
   - `bundle exec erb_lint ./app/**/*.erb -a` - ERB linting with auto-correct

3. **Security** (Required):
   - `bin/brakeman --no-pager` - Security analysis

Only proceed with pull request creation if ALL checks pass.

## General Development Rules

### Authentication Context
- Use `Current.user` for the current user. Do NOT use `current_user`.
- Use `Current.family` for the current family. Do NOT use `current_family`.

### Development Guidelines
- Prior to generating any code, carefully read the project conventions and guidelines
- Ignore i18n methods and files. Hardcode strings in English for now to optimize speed of development
- Do not run `rails server` in your responses
- Do not run `touch tmp/restart.txt`
- Do not run `rails credentials`
- Do not automatically run migrations

## High-Level Architecture

### Application Modes
The Maybe app runs in two distinct modes:
- **Managed**: The Maybe team operates and manages servers for users (Rails.application.config.app_mode = "managed")
- **Self Hosted**: Users host the Maybe app on their own infrastructure, typically through Docker Compose (Rails.application.config.app_mode = "self_hosted")

### Core Domain Model
The application is built around financial data management with these key relationships:
- **User** → has many **Accounts** → has many **Transactions**
- **Account** types: checking, savings, credit cards, investments, crypto, loans, properties
- **Transaction** → belongs to **Category**, can have **Tags** and **Rules**
- **Investment accounts** → have **Holdings** → track **Securities** via **Trades**

### API Architecture
The application provides both internal and external APIs:
- Internal API: Controllers serve JSON via Turbo for SPA-like interactions
- External API: `/api/v1/` namespace with Doorkeeper OAuth and API key authentication
- API responses use Jbuilder templates for JSON rendering
- Rate limiting via Rack Attack with configurable limits per API key

### Sync & Import System
Two primary data ingestion methods:
1. **Plaid Integration**: Real-time bank account syncing
   - `PlaidItem` manages connections
   - `Sync` tracks sync operations
   - Background jobs handle data updates
2. **CSV Import**: Manual data import with mapping
   - `Import` manages import sessions
   - Supports transaction and balance imports
   - Custom field mapping with transformation rules

### Background Processing
Sidekiq handles asynchronous tasks:
- Account syncing (`SyncAccountsJob`)
- Import processing (`ImportDataJob`)
- AI chat responses (`CreateChatResponseJob`)
- Scheduled maintenance via sidekiq-cron

### Frontend Architecture
- **Hotwire Stack**: Turbo + Stimulus for reactive UI without heavy JavaScript
- **ViewComponents**: Reusable UI components in `app/components/`
- **Stimulus Controllers**: Handle interactivity, organized alongside components
- **Charts**: D3.js for financial visualizations (time series, donut, sankey)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.x with custom design system
  - Design system defined in `app/assets/tailwind/maybe-design-system.css`
  - Always use functional tokens (e.g., `text-primary` not `text-white`)
  - Prefer semantic HTML elements over JS components
  - Use `icon` helper for icons, never `lucide_icon` directly

### Multi-Currency Support
- All monetary values stored in base currency (user's primary currency)
- Exchange rates fetched from Synth API
- `Money` objects handle currency conversion and formatting
- Historical exchange rates for accurate reporting

### Security & Authentication
- Session-based auth for web users
- API authentication via:
  - OAuth2 (Doorkeeper) for third-party apps
  - API keys with JWT tokens for direct API access
- Scoped permissions system for API access
- Strong parameters and CSRF protection throughout

### Testing Philosophy
- Comprehensive test coverage using Rails' built-in Minitest
- Fixtures for test data (avoid FactoryBot)
- Keep fixtures minimal (2-3 per model for base cases)
- VCR for external API testing
- System tests for critical user flows (use sparingly)
- Test helpers in `test/support/` for common scenarios
- Only test critical code paths that significantly increase confidence
- Write tests as you go, when required

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries optimized with proper indexes
- N+1 queries prevented via includes/joins
- Background jobs for heavy operations
- Caching strategies for expensive calculations
- Turbo Frames for partial page updates

### Development Workflow
- Feature branches merged to `main`
- Docker support for consistent environments
- Environment variables via `.env` files
- Lookbook for component development (`/lookbook`)
- Letter Opener for email preview in development

## Project Conventions

### Convention 1: Minimize Dependencies
- Push Rails to its limits before adding new dependencies
- Strong technical/business reason required for new dependencies
- Favor old and reliable over new and flashy

### Convention 2: Skinny Controllers, Fat Models
- Business logic in `app/models/` folder, avoid `app/services/`
- Use Rails concerns and POROs for organization
- Models should answer questions about themselves: `account.balance_series` not `AccountSeries.new(account).call`

### Convention 3: Hotwire-First Frontend
- **Native HTML preferred over JS components**
  - Use `<dialog>` for modals, `<details><summary>` for disclosures
- **Leverage Turbo frames** for page sections over client-side solutions
- **Query params for state** over localStorage/sessions
- **Server-side formatting** for currencies, numbers, dates
- **Always use `icon` helper** in `application_helper.rb`, NEVER `lucide_icon` directly

### Convention 4: Optimize for Simplicity
- Prioritize good OOP domain design over performance
- Focus performance only on critical/global areas (avoid N+1 queries, mindful of global layouts)

### Convention 5: Database vs ActiveRecord Validations
- Simple validations (null checks, unique indexes) in DB
- ActiveRecord validations for convenience in forms (prefer client-side when possible)
- Complex validations and business logic in ActiveRecord

## TailwindCSS Design System

### Design System Rules
- **Always reference `app/assets/tailwind/maybe-design-system.css`** for primitives and tokens
- **Use functional tokens** defined in design system:
  - `text-primary` instead of `text-white`
  - `bg-container` instead of `bg-white`
  - `border border-primary` instead of `border border-gray-200`
- **NEVER create new styles** in design system files without permission
- **Always generate semantic HTML**

## Component Architecture

### ViewComponent vs Partials Decision Making

**Use ViewComponents when:**
- Element has complex logic or styling patterns
- Element will be reused across multiple views/contexts
- Element needs structured styling with variants/sizes
- Element requires interactive behavior or Stimulus controllers
- Element has configurable slots or complex APIs
- Element needs accessibility features or ARIA support

**Use Partials when:**
- Element is primarily static HTML with minimal logic
- Element is used in only one or few specific contexts
- Element is simple template content
- Element doesn't need variants, sizes, or complex configuration
- Element is more about content organization than reusable functionality

**Component Guidelines:**
- Prefer components over partials when available
- Keep domain logic OUT of view templates
- Logic belongs in component files, not template files

### Stimulus Controller Guidelines

**Declarative Actions (Required):**
```erb
<!-- GOOD: Declarative - HTML declares what happens -->
<div data-controller="toggle">
  <button data-action="click->toggle#toggle" data-toggle-target="button">Show</button>
  <div data-toggle-target="content" class="hidden">Hello World!</div>
</div>
```

**Controller Best Practices:**
- Keep controllers lightweight and simple (< 7 targets)
- Use private methods and expose clear public API
- Single responsibility or highly related responsibilities
- Component controllers stay in component directory, global controllers in `app/javascript/controllers/`
- Pass data via `data-*-value` attributes, not inline JavaScript

## Testing Philosophy

### General Testing Rules
- **ALWAYS use Minitest + fixtures** (NEVER RSpec or factories)
- Keep fixtures minimal (2-3 per model for base cases)
- Create edge cases on-the-fly within test context
- Use Rails helpers for large fixture creation needs

### Test Quality Guidelines
- **Write minimal, effective tests** - system tests sparingly
- **Only test critical and important code paths**
- **Test boundaries correctly:**
  - Commands: test they were called with correct params
  - Queries: test output
  - Don't test implementation details of other classes

### Testing Examples

```ruby
# GOOD - Testing critical domain business logic
test "syncs balances" do
  Holding::Syncer.any_instance.expects(:sync_holdings).returns([]).once
  assert_difference "@account.balances.count", 2 do
    Balance::Syncer.new(@account, strategy: :forward).sync_balances
  end
end

# BAD - Testing ActiveRecord functionality
test "saves balance" do 
  balance_record = Balance.new(balance: 100, currency: "USD")
  assert balance_record.save
end
```

### Stubs and Mocks
- Use `mocha` gem
- Prefer `OpenStruct` for mock instances
- Only mock what's necessary

<!-- BACKLOG.MD GUIDELINES START -->
# Instructions for the usage of Backlog.md CLI Tool

## Backlog.md: Comprehensive Project Management Tool via CLI

### Assistant Objective

Efficiently manage all project tasks, status, and documentation using the Backlog.md CLI, ensuring all project metadata
remains fully synchronized and up-to-date.

### Core Capabilities

- ✅ **Task Management**: Create, edit, assign, prioritize, and track tasks with full metadata
- ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: Granular control with add/remove/check/uncheck by index
- ✅ **Board Visualization**: Terminal-based Kanban board (`backlog board`) and web UI (`backlog browser`)
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Automatic tracking of task states across branches
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Task relationships and subtask hierarchies
- ✅ **Documentation & Decisions**: Structured docs and architectural decision records
- ✅ **Export & Reporting**: Generate markdown reports and board snapshots
- ✅ **AI-Optimized**: `--plain` flag provides clean text output for AI processing

### Why This Matters to You (AI Agent)

1. **Comprehensive system** - Full project management capabilities through CLI
2. **The CLI is the interface** - All operations go through `backlog` commands
3. **Unified interaction model** - You can use CLI for both reading (`backlog task 1 --plain`) and writing (
   `backlog task edit 1`)
4. **Metadata stays synchronized** - The CLI handles all the complex relationships

### Key Understanding

- **Tasks** live in `backlog/tasks/` as `task-<id> - <title>.md` files
- **You interact via CLI only**: `backlog task create`, `backlog task edit`, etc.
- **Use `--plain` flag** for AI-friendly output when viewing/listing
- **Never bypass the CLI** - It handles Git, metadata, file naming, and relationships

---

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER EDIT TASK FILES DIRECTLY. Edit Only via CLI

**ALL task operations MUST use the Backlog.md CLI commands**

- ✅ **DO**: Use `backlog task edit` and other CLI commands
- ✅ **DO**: Use `backlog task create` to create new tasks
- ✅ **DO**: Use `backlog task edit <id> --check-ac <index>` to mark acceptance criteria
- ❌ **DON'T**: Edit markdown files directly
- ❌ **DON'T**: Manually change checkboxes in files
- ❌ **DON'T**: Add or modify text in task files without using CLI

**Why?** Direct file editing breaks metadata synchronization, Git tracking, and task relationships.

---

## 1. Source of Truth & File Structure

### 📖 **UNDERSTANDING** (What you'll see when reading)

- Markdown task files live under **`backlog/tasks/`** (drafts under **`backlog/drafts/`**)
- Files are named: `task-<id> - <title>.md` (e.g., `task-42 - Add GraphQL resolver.md`)
- Project documentation is in **`backlog/docs/`**
- Project decisions are in **`backlog/decisions/`**

### 🔧 **ACTING** (How to change things)

- **All task operations MUST use the Backlog.md CLI tool**
- This ensures metadata is correctly updated and the project stays in sync
- **Always use `--plain` flag** when listing or viewing tasks for AI-friendly text output

---

## 2. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **WRONG: Direct File Editing**

```markdown
# DON'T DO THIS:

1. Open backlog/tasks/task-7 - Feature.md in editor
2. Change "- [ ]" to "- [x]" manually
3. Add notes directly to the file
4. Save the file
```

### ✅ **CORRECT: Using CLI Commands**

```bash
# DO THIS INSTEAD:
backlog task edit 7 --check-ac 1  # Mark AC #1 as complete
backlog task edit 7 --notes "Implementation complete"  # Add notes
backlog task edit 7 -s "In Progress" -a @agent-k  # Multiple commands: change status and assign the task when you start working on the task
```

---

## 3. Understanding Task Format (Read-Only Reference)

⚠️ **FORMAT REFERENCE ONLY** - The following sections show what you'll SEE in task files.
**Never edit these directly! Use CLI commands to make changes.**

| Uncheck AC #2           | `backlog task edit 42 --uncheck-ac 2`                    |
| Remove AC #3            | `backlog task edit 42 --remove-ac 3`                     |
| Add Plan                | `backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Step one\n2. Step two"` |
| Add Notes (replace)     | `backlog task edit 42 --notes "What I did"`              |
| Append Notes            | `backlog task edit 42 --append-notes "Another note"` |

---

## 4. Defining Tasks

### Creating New Tasks

**Always use CLI to create tasks:**

```bash
# Example
backlog task create "Task title" -d "Description" --ac "First criterion" --ac "Second criterion"
```

### Title (one liner)

Use a clear brief title that summarizes the task.

### Description (The "why")

Provide a concise summary of the task purpose and its goal. Explains the context without implementation details.

### Acceptance Criteria (The "what")

**Understanding the Format:**

- Acceptance criteria appear as numbered checkboxes in the markdown files
- Format: `- [ ] #1 Criterion text` (unchecked) or `- [x] #1 Criterion text` (checked)

**Managing Acceptance Criteria via CLI:**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: How AC Commands Work**

- **Adding criteria (`--ac`)** accepts multiple flags: `--ac "First" --ac "Second"` ✅
- **Checking/unchecking/removing** accept multiple flags too: `--check-ac 1 --check-ac 2` ✅
- **Mixed operations** work in a single command: `--check-ac 1 --uncheck-ac 2 --remove-ac 3` ✅

```bash
# Examples

# Add new criteria (MULTIPLE values allowed)
backlog task edit 42 --ac "User can login" --ac "Session persists"

# Check specific criteria by index (MULTIPLE values supported)
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1 --check-ac 2 --check-ac 3  # Check multiple ACs
# Or check them individually if you prefer:
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1    # Mark #1 as complete
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 2    # Mark #2 as complete

# Mixed operations in single command
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1 --uncheck-ac 2 --remove-ac 3

# ❌ STILL WRONG - These formats don't work:
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1,2,3  # No comma-separated values
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1-3    # No ranges
# backlog task edit 42 --check 1         # Wrong flag name

# Multiple operations of same type
backlog task edit 42 --uncheck-ac 1 --uncheck-ac 2  # Uncheck multiple ACs
backlog task edit 42 --remove-ac 2 --remove-ac 4    # Remove multiple ACs (processed high-to-low)
```

**Key Principles for Good ACs:**

- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on the result, not the method.
- **Testable/Verifiable:** Each criterion should be objectively testable
- **Clear and Concise:** Unambiguous language
- **Complete:** Collectively cover the task scope
- **User-Focused:** Frame from end-user or system behavior perspective

Good Examples:

- "User can successfully log in with valid credentials"
- "System processes 1000 requests per second without errors"
- "CLI preserves literal newlines in description/plan/notes; `\\n` sequences are not auto‑converted"

Bad Example (Implementation Step):

- "Add a new function handleLogin() in auth.ts"
- "Define expected behavior and document supported input patterns"

### Task Breakdown Strategy

1. Identify foundational components first
2. Create tasks in dependency order (foundations before features)
3. Ensure each task delivers value independently
4. Avoid creating tasks that block each other

### Task Requirements

- Tasks must be **atomic** and **testable** or **verifiable**
- Each task should represent a single unit of work for one PR
- **Never** reference future tasks (only tasks with id < current task id)
- Ensure tasks are **independent** and don't depend on future work

---

## 5. Implementing Tasks

### 5.1. First step when implementing a task

The very first things you must do when you take over a task are:

* set the task in progress
* assign it to yourself

```bash
# Example
backlog task edit 42 -s "In Progress" -a @{myself}
```

### 5.2. Create an Implementation Plan (The "how")

Previously created tasks contain the why and the what. Once you are familiar with that part you should think about a
plan on **HOW** to tackle the task and all its acceptance criteria. This is your **Implementation Plan**.
First do a quick check to see if all the tools that you are planning to use are available in the environment you are
working in.   
When you are ready, write it down in the task so that you can refer to it later.

```bash
# Example
backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Research codebase for references\n2Research on internet for similar cases\n3. Implement\n4. Test"
```

## 5.3. Implementation

Once you have a plan, you can start implementing the task. This is where you write code, run tests, and make sure
everything works as expected. Follow the acceptance criteria one by one and MARK THEM AS COMPLETE as soon as you
finish them.

### 5.4 Implementation Notes (PR description)

When you are done implementing a tasks you need to prepare a PR description for it.
Because you cannot create PRs directly, write the PR as a clean description in the task notes.
Append notes progressively during implementation using `--append-notes`:

```
backlog task edit 42 --append-notes "Implemented X" --append-notes "Added tests"
```

```bash
# Example
backlog task edit 42 --notes "Implemented using pattern X because Reason Y, modified files Z and W"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include an Implementation Plan when creating a task. The plan is added only after you start the
implementation.

- Creation phase: provide Title, Description, Acceptance Criteria, and optionally labels/priority/assignee.
- When you begin work, switch to edit, set the task in progress and assign to yourself
  `backlog task edit <id> -s "In Progress" -a "..."`.
- Think about how you would solve the task and add the plan: `backlog task edit <id> --plan "..."`.
- Add Implementation Notes only after completing the work: `backlog task edit <id> --notes "..."` (replace) or append progressively using `--append-notes`.

## Phase discipline: What goes where

- Creation: Title, Description, Acceptance Criteria, labels/priority/assignee.
- Implementation: Implementation Plan (after moving to In Progress and assigning to yourself).
- Wrap-up: Implementation Notes (Like a PR description), AC and Definition of Done checks.

**IMPORTANT**: Only implement what's in the Acceptance Criteria. If you need to do more, either:

1. Update the AC first: `backlog task edit 42 --ac "New requirement"`
2. Or create a new follow up task: `backlog task create "Additional feature"`

---

## 6. Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Identify work
backlog task list -s "To Do" --plain

# 2. Read task details
backlog task 42 --plain

# 3. Start work: assign yourself & change status
backlog task edit 42 -s "In Progress" -a @myself

# 4. Add implementation plan
backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Analyze\n2. Refactor\n3. Test"

# 5. Work on the task (write code, test, etc.)

# 6. Mark acceptance criteria as complete (supports multiple in one command)
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1 --check-ac 2 --check-ac 3  # Check all at once
# Or check them individually if preferred:
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 2
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 3

# 7. Add implementation notes (PR Description)
backlog task edit 42 --notes "Refactored using strategy pattern, updated tests"

# 8. Mark task as done
backlog task edit 42 -s Done
```

---

## 7. Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is **Done** only when **ALL** of the following are complete:

### ✅ Via CLI Commands:

1. **All acceptance criteria checked**: Use `backlog task edit <id> --check-ac <index>` for each
2. **Implementation notes added**: Use `backlog task edit <id> --notes "..."`
3. **Status set to Done**: Use `backlog task edit <id> -s Done`

### ✅ Via Code/Testing:

4. **Tests pass**: Run test suite and linting
5. **Documentation updated**: Update relevant docs if needed
6. **Code reviewed**: Self-review your changes
7. **No regressions**: Performance, security checks pass

⚠️ **NEVER mark a task as Done without completing ALL items above**

### Task Content

| Action           | Command                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Add plan         | `backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Step one\n2. Step two"` |
| Add notes        | `backlog task edit 42 --notes "Implementation details"`  |
| Add dependencies | `backlog task edit 42 --dep task-1 --dep task-2`         |

### Multi‑line Input (Description/Plan/Notes)

The CLI preserves input literally. Shells do not convert `\n` inside normal quotes. Use one of the following to insert real newlines:

- Bash/Zsh (ANSI‑C quoting):
  - Description: `backlog task edit 42 --desc $'Line1\nLine2\n\nFinal'`
  - Plan: `backlog task edit 42 --plan $'1. A\n2. B'`
  - Notes: `backlog task edit 42 --notes $'Done A\nDoing B'`
  - Append notes: `backlog task edit 42 --append-notes $'Progress update line 1\nLine 2'`
- POSIX portable (printf):
  - `backlog task edit 42 --notes "$(printf 'Line1\nLine2')"`
- PowerShell (backtick n):
  - `backlog task edit 42 --notes "Line1`nLine2"`

Do not expect `"...\n..."` to become a newline. That passes the literal backslash + n to the CLI by design.

Descriptions support literal newlines; shell examples may show escaped `\\n`, but enter a single `\n` to create a newline.

## Common Issues

| Problem              | Solution                                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task not found       | Check task ID with `backlog task list --plain`                     |
| AC won't check       | Use correct index: `backlog task 42 --plain` to see AC numbers     |
| Changes not saving   | Ensure you're using CLI, not editing files                         |
| Metadata out of sync | Re-edit via CLI to fix: `backlog task edit 42 -s <current-status>` |

## Remember: The Golden Rule

**🎯 If you want to change ANYTHING in a task, use the `backlog task edit` command.**
**📖 Use CLI to read tasks, exceptionally READ task files directly, never WRITE to them.**
